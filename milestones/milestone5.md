- [x] The project includes a custom non-RESTful route with corresponding controller actions
- [x] The user can filter or sort items based on particular criteria as appropriate for your use case
- [x] Data is automatically generated in response to a certain event or user action. Examples include generating a default inventory for a new user starting a game or creating a starter set of tasks for a user creating a new task app account
- [x] Data submitted via a POST or PATCH request is validated before the database is updated (e.g. validating that an event is in the future before allowing a new event to be created)

## Reflection

### 1. What went well during this unit?

Deployment went smoothly — getting the full stack (Express + React + Postgres) running on Render without major issues was a win. We also wrapped up several stretch features like GitHub OAuth, toast notifications, and image uploads via Cloudinary that came together in the final stretch.

### 2. What were some challenges your group faced in this unit?

Coordinating across team members in the final week was tough — some features (like protected routes and Cloudinary) were still in progress close to the deadline, which created some uncertainty about what would make it in. Managing async work and keeping the checklist up to date required extra communication.

### 3. What were some of the highlights or achievements that you are most proud of in this project?

Building a full authentication flow with GitHub OAuth and Passport.js from scratch was a highlight — it touched every layer of the stack (database sessions, backend middleware, frontend context, and protected routes). We're also proud of how the recipe system turned out, with category filtering, validation, and a clean component hierarchy that made the UI feel polished.

### 4. Reflecting on your web development journey so far, how have you grown since the beginning of the course?

At the start of the course, building a backend API or wiring up a database felt abstract. Now it's second nature to design a schema, write RESTful routes, and connect them to a React frontend. The biggest growth has been in thinking about the full picture — how auth, data modeling, validation, and UI state all interact — rather than just making individual pieces work in isolation. Deployment was also a major step; most courses skip it entirely, but getting a real app running on Render with a live database made everything feel more concrete and real.

### 5. Looking ahead, what are your goals related to web development, and what steps do you plan to take to achieve them?

The goal is to keep building real projects that push past what was covered in the course — things like more complex data models, real-time features, and better UX patterns. The next step is to get more comfortable with TypeScript on the frontend (we already adopted it on the backend), and to explore more of the deployment side: CI/CD pipelines, environment management, and monitoring. Ultimately, the aim is to be able to take a product idea from zero to shipped, independently.
